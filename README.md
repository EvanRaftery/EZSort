Welcome! This repository is the main documentation of our work for ECE415 and ECE416. Our senior design project is EZSort, a modular item sorter that makes use of computer vision and neural networks to classify items. This README file will give a brief overview on what resources were used, how the files function, and how to run the code as a whole.

(To be finished at a later date)
